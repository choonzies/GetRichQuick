# getRichQuick
A web app that crawls the web for stock information, then predicts the price movement using an LSTM model in neural networks. 

**By entering the ticker of a stock, you will be able to extract the closing price from the previous 5 days.**

**LSTM model will make predictions on the future prices (up to 7 days) based on the extracted data.**


## Features üî•üî•

- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predict future stock prices based on historical data using an LSTM model.
- **Interactive Frontend**: User-friendly interface built with React.
- **Robust Backend**: Django backend for processing predictions and serving results.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches historical stock data using the `yfinance` library.

## Tech Stack ‚õèÔ∏è

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Django
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance (`yfinance` library)
