# getRichQuick
A web app that crawls the web for stock information, then predicts the price movement using an LSTM model in neural networks. 

**By entering the ticker of a stock, you will be able to extract the closing price from the previous 5 days.**

**LSTM model will make predictions on the future prices (up to 7 days) based on the extracted data.**


## Features üî•üî•

- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predict future stock prices based on historical data using an LSTM model.
- **Interactive Frontend**: User-friendly interface built with React.
- **Robust Backend**: Django backend for processing predictions and serving results.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches historical stock data using the `yfinance` library.

## Tech Stack ‚õèÔ∏è

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Django
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance (`yfinance` library)

## Installation

- Ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:
  - Python 3.12.8
  - Node.js 22.12.0
  - React 19.0.0
  - Django 5.1.5
  - PyTorch 2.5.1

1) Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lifrocszh/getRichQuick.git
```
2) `cd` into the first backend folder, then run `python manage.py runserver 9000`
   (Important: Set 9000 as the port number)
3) `cd` into the frontend folder, then run `npm start`
4) Wait for both browser windows to open, then access the window with the UI.
5) Key in any ticker from Yahoo! finance, and watch the price predictions!
